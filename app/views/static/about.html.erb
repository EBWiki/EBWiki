<h1>About EBWiki:</h1>
<h3>Our Mission:</h3>
<p>EBWiki is singularly devoted to providing victims, their families and their communities the tools to end the abuse and indiscriminant killing by the police of African Americans and other people of color.  EBWiki's crowdsourced information platform enables families and community organizations to track the progression of current and past cases in real time and to access and share information across geographies.</p>

<p>While we recognize the need for quality policing and for law enforcement officers to be able to defend themselves, reviewing the police killings of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and many other less publicized cases, it is clear that we have a problem in this country when it comes to the relationship between law enforcement and citizens of color.</p>

<p>In the most egregious of these cases, where there is irrefutable, public documentation of police abuses in the form of video or audio recordings, we have often seen protests, violence and a spate of news stories. However, usually within a few weeks of the incident, interest fatigues and the story fades from public discourse until the next video or recording surfaces and the process repeats itself. At EBWiki, we believe strongly, after decades of observing it, that this pattern will not correct itself. EBWiki is aimed at creating a more active awareness that will have a positive impact on these cases.</p>

<h3>Others Who Inspire us:</h3>
<p>At EBWiki, we believe the first essential step in addressing this issue is to inventory the problem by gathering data about the number of people affected by police abuse, statistics on race, gender, class and geography. We look with admiration on the work being done in this regard by:

<p>By consolidating the raw data and applying statistical analysis to these cases, these resources will be invaluable in the ongoing work to eradicate this behavior.</p>

<h3>EBWiki’s Contribution:</h3>

<p>EBWiki’s work begins where the other groups leave off. EBWiki considers each new incident report as just the beginning of a potentially years-long process that will exceed our collective attention span if we allow it to.  Instead, EBWiki follows these events as new information comes to light, tracking community organization responses, litigation milestones as well as looking longitudinally at what happens to the players over time. Questions like, “Was there an indictment or conviction?”, “where is the officer in question working now?” and “What related indignities have whistleblowers endured?” are some of the questions we will track.</p>

<p>For example, the case involving the shooting of two unarmed homeless people by Cleveland Police Officer Scott Brelo is one example where EBWiki could have helped. In that case, after a car chase of the two victims, Officer Brelo stood on the hood of their parked car and emptied 15 rounds through their windshield riddling both of their bodies with bullets and ensuring their deaths. Yet despite being indicted, two years later in a directed verdict -- quietly announced on a holiday weekend -- Officer Brelo was found innocent. We believe that EBWiki’s "crowd" shining a light on these legal proceedings as they were happening could have resulted in more equitable results.</p>

<p>Likewise, by tracking the activity of community groups and families in these cases as they occur across America, we believe we can facilitate sharing of key information that will allow us to learn from each other’s experiences and improve our overall responses to these events when they occur.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly and succinctly stated, our ultimate goal is  to extend the lives of victims beyond the two-week attention span of the mainstream media to enable us to organize a collective response politically or otherwise.</p>
